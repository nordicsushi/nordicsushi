## About Me
</div>
<p>I love building software. To me, building things is the only way to turn ideas into something real and make a difference in the world.</p>

<p>I mostly build in Python, but lately, I’ve been learning Rust—partly because Rust is quietly powering much of the modern Python ecosystem, and partly because I enjoy a good intellectual challenge. In an age where “vibe coding” with AI is taking over, wrestling with Rust feels like a refreshing workout for the brain.</p>

<p>When it comes to AI, I use it at work to boost efficiency (with careful review, of course), but I avoid it in my side projects. I still genuinely enjoy coding by hand—digging through documentation, figuring things out, and feeling that little spark when something finally works.</p>

<p>That said, if we ever reach a point where Markdown is the only language we use to “code,” I might hang up my keyboard and become a carpenter—building cat trees for my three cats instead of software.</p>
